# Cross-Lingual-NER
Repository for my potential Master's thesis topic on **Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Named Entity Recognition**.

For my Master's thesis, I am planning to perform cross-lingual transfer learning on the NER task between a high-resource language and Romanian, which can be considered a low-resource language.
